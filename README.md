# NextJS

A very simple boilerplate of a NextJS project. For demonstration purposes. 

NextJS is a React framework. It has a bunch of cool features while maintaining the component design philosophy we all love. Check some of those features out [here](https://nextjs.org/).

This is a very simple boilerplate that will follow the same path as the following [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/). You can do the tutorial with this as the starting foundation.

Happy building!
